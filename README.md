## Project Structure

Here’s a high-level overview of key directories/files:

```
social-media-platform/
│
├── accounts/            # Django app for user registration, profiles
├── posts/               # Django app for posts, comments, feeds
├── social_clone/        # Main project settings & URLs
├── manage.py
├── requirements.txt
└── notes.txt.txt        # (Probably project notes)
```

* `accounts/`: Handles user models, authentication, profile data
* `posts/`: Handles post creation, display, edit, comments, follow logic
* `social_clone/`: Django project folder (settings, URLs, wsgi)

---

## Usage

1. Register a new user (or login if you already have one).
2. Create posts, edit or delete your own posts.
3. View other users’ profiles and follow/unfollow them.
4. Comment on posts.
5. View a feed that aggregates posts from users you follow.

---

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

* Pagination for feeds and post lists
* Likes / reactions (e.g. heart, thumbs up)
* Direct messaging between users
* Notifications (e.g. when someone follows you or comments)
* Media uploads (images, videos)
* Search functionality (users, posts, hashtags)
* REST API / Mobile support (using Django REST Framework)
* Deployment to production (with a more robust DB, static file handling, etc.)
* Unit tests & continuous integration
